Ingredients
------------

========== ============================================
2          Pork chops
1.5 tbsp   Mustard
5 tbsp     Cr√®me fraiche or thick cream (heavy cream)
50g        Grated swiss gruyere or comte cheese
========== ============================================


Method
-------

1. Remove pork chops from the fridge at least 15 minutes before cooking. Remove the skin, coat with the salt and brush both sides with oil.
2. Heat a pan on medium heat and start cooking the chops once the pan is hot.  Cook for at least 10-12 minutes until the core temperature of the meat reaches 65C (150F). Once cooked, transfer the chops to a plate.
3. Now, turn your oven broiler (griller) on so that it's hot when you're ready to broil the chops. 
4. Whisk the cream, mustard and cheese together in a bowl.  
5. Generously coat one side of the chops with the mixture and sprinkle black pepper on top and more cheese if you like. 
6. Broil (grill) the chops close to the top of the oven for 5 minutes until the cheese is light brown and crisp but be careful not to burn the cheese.

==========  ==================================================
30g         Psyllium powder
600ml       Water
750g        Doves Farm gluten-free strong bread flour blend
3 tbsp      Nigella seeds

==========  ==================================================


Method
--------

1. Mix the psyllium powder with 300ml of water. Leave to one side and allow the mixture to thicken.
2. Tip the flour and nigella seeds into a mixing bowl. Add the sugar and salt to one side of the bowl 	and the yeast to the other. Crack the egg into 
the centre of the flour, add the vinegar, olive oil and the psyllium mixture. Combine the ingredients to form a soft dough. Gradually add the remaining 300ml water (you may not need it all, although the dough should be soft and slightly sticky).
3. Place onto a floured surface and knead to form a smooth dough. Place back in the bowl, cover and leave to rest for 1½ hours until doubled in size.
4. Heat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan/425°F/Gas 7 and place 3 heavy-duty baking trays in the oven to heat up.
5. Dust your work surface with flour. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces and shape each one into a ball. Roll or press the pieces into oval shapes 
about 4mm thick.

1. Preheat the oven to  180Â°C. Mix the oats, cherries, cranberries and seeds together in a bowl. Pour in the melted butter and mix in thoroughly to make sure the oats are well coated
2. On a separate plate, mash the bananas into a pulp with a fork, then add to the oat mixture and mix well. Spread the mixture into a 30x20cm tin and bake in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Once cooked, transfer to a wire rack to cool, then cut into 6 bars

.. hint:: 
  
  If your first batch is more crumbly than you'd like, try increasing the amount of mashed banana to moisten the mixture before baking. You can also Add cinnamon or mixed spice to taste

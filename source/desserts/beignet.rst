500ml   Milk 
100g    Sugar 
120g    Butter 
1tsp    Salt 
1/2 tsp Lemon zest 
300g    Plain flour 
5       Whole eggs 
2ltr    Oil for frying

- Caster sugar to coat the dough balls
- Raspberry jam

Method 
------

1. Place a large saucepan on the stove, turn the heat on medium, and pour in all of the following ingredients in the saucepan in this order:milk, sugar, salt, lemon zest, then butter. Bring that mix to the boil. **As soon as the milk boils**, turn the heat off completely.

2. When you milk base is ready (make sure you heat is off) add all of the flour in one time. Use a wooden spoon to incorporate the flour with the milk based. Start by mixing slowing then vigorously. Very quickly a large ball of dough will form in the pan. Reserve the dough in a large bowl and let it cool down for 5 minutes.

3. To make things faster and easier you will need to use a food processor. However if you want to use a spoon instead to incorporate the eggs the technique is the same, but will take longer and will be difficult due to the stiffness and of the dough ball. Back to the recipe: Attach a dough blade on the food processor bowl and put all of the dough in. Beat **3 whole eggs** to start off with, and pour them over the dough in the food processor bowl use a pulse function to start incorporating the eggs with the dough and when it starts to incorporate let the food processor run on continuous speed until the dough and the eggs are totally blended together - just a minute or so. When done, stop the food processor and **add the 2 other beaten eggs** to the dough and repeat the process again until all the eggs are incorporated. Take all of the dough out of the food processor and reserve it in a clean preparation bowl. We are now ready to fry the dough ball (nuns fart)

4. Warm up you oil to 170Â°C. When the oil is a the right temperature, use two spoon to create dough "balls" as best as you can (as shown on video) and add them directly to the oil. They will sink to the bottom and shortly afterwards start to float on the top of the oil. When this happen you will have to let the dough balls cook for a few minutes, turning them carefully so that hey get evenly colored and most importantly to give them them to **puff up** (they can sometimes double in size). When each batch is ready place them on a tray or plate covered with a paper towel to absorb the oil

5. When all the "Nuns farts" are ready roll them in granulated or icing sugar making sure they are fully covered with sugar. You are now ready to serve. These delicacies can be eaten as is, or served with various jams, chocolate paste or salted caramel. In the video I have stacked up the "Nuns Farts" in a cauldron and decorate them with creepy eyes balls :o) but that is just one idea. Enjoy!

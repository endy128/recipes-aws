Method

Cream
""""""

1. In a medium bowl beat the cream and sugar until thick peaks appear (very thick).
2. In a medium bowl beat (with same beaters) the mascarpone and vanilla until smooth and creamy.
3. Add the whipped cream to the mascarpone mixture and whisk strongly until smooth. Don't over mix. Use as a topping for cakes or fresh fruit. Enjoy!
4. Pipe over the top of the cooled mince pies.


Pastry
""""""

1. For the pastry, mix the flour and xanthan gum together in a large mixing bowl. Add the very cold butter cubes to the bowl and mix it into the flour. Using your fingertips, rub the butter into the flour to form a breadcrumb-like consistency. Stir in the sugar.
2. Add the beaten egg to the bowl and, using a knife, carefully cut it into the mixture until it comes together. It should form a ball and not be crumbly - it will be a little sticky to touch, but not unmanageable. Wrap the dough in cling film and leave to chill in the fridge for around 1 hour before using.
3. Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Lightly grease a 12-hole muffin or cupcake tin. Remove the pastry from the fridge. If the dough feels really firm, leave it out at room temperature briefly before attempting to roll it.
4. Lightly flour a rolling pin. Roll the dough out to a 3mm/⅛in thickness on a large sheet of baking paper (aim to roll out a large rectangle). Remember not to handle the dough excessively as you work with it, as this will warm it up and make it more fragile. Use a 9cm/3½in circular biscuit cutter to cut out 12 circles for the base of the mince pies. Carefully ease them into the holes on the pre-greased muffin or cupcake tin, pressing them in gently. Spoon around 1-2 tsp mincemeat into each hole

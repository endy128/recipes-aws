Method

Cream
""""""

1. In a medium bowl beat the cream and sugar until thick peaks appear (very thick).
2. In a medium bowl beat (with same beaters) the mascarpone and vanilla until smooth and creamy.
3. Add the whipped cream to the mascarpone mixture and whisk strongly until smooth. Don't over mix. Use as a topping for cakes or fresh fruit. Enjoy!
4. Pipe over the top of the cooled mince pies.


Pastry
""""""

1. For the pastry, put the flour, icing sugar, butter and orange zest into a food processor and whizz into fine crumbs. With the motor running, add the egg and whizz for a few seconds until the mixture forms clumps and you can press it together into a ball. (If necessary, add 1–3 tsp ice-cold water to bring the dough together.)
2. Turn onto a very lightly floured surface and knead briefly until smooth.
3. Wrap in cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes, or until firm. (The pastry can be made up to 3 days ahead or frozen for up to a month.)
4. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to the thickness of a £1 coin. Using an 8cm fluted cutter, cut out 24 rounds and use to line two 12-hole non-stick mince pie tins.
5. Re-roll the trimmings to the same thickness and stamp out 24 stars or Christmas trees, with an appropriate cutter, for the tops. Put a dessertspoonful (2 tsp) filling into each pastry case, then press the tops in position.
6. Chill for at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180°C/Gas 4.
7. Brush the tops with the egg-wash, then bake the mince pies for 15-20 minutes until the pastry is golden and crisp. Let cool for a few minutes before removing from the tins and transferring to a wire rack to cool.
8. Store an airtight container for up to 1 week. Warm slightly before serving, with a dusting of sugar.
